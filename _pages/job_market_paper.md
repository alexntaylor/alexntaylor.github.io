<sub>Uses generalized difference-in-differences and event study designs to assess the impact of confederate monument dedications on congressional voting patterns in the US South from 1878-1912. I find that monument dedications are associated with an increase in Democratic Party vote share. I also find that these counties saw a decrease in voter turnout and the black population. This implies that monuments affect how societies are perceived and perceive themselves, which affect political outcomes.

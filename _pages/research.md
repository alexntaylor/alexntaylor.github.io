## A Few Things I'm Working On...

**Public Symbols and Voting Behavior: Confederate Monuments in the Post-Reconstruction South**\\
<sub>Uses a Two-Way Fixed Effects model to assess the impact of confederate monument dedications on congressional voting patterns in the US South from 1872-1912. I find that monument dedications are associated with increases in the percentage of voters voting for Democratic candidates, which were largely anti-Reconstruction. This implies that monuments affect how societies are perceived and perceive themselves, which have political consequences. Further updates to come!</sub>

**The Impact of the Black Death on the Adoption of the Printing Press**
(joint with Noel D. Johnson and Andrew Thomas)\\
\\
Uses a three stage model to predict the impact of Black Death mortality on the later adoption of the printing press. We find that cities with higher levels of Black Death mortality were less likely to adopt the printing press before both 1600. We also find that higher Black Death mortality is associated with later adoption and higher levels of printing specialization on the intensive margin. This suggests that market size is important in the adoption of labor-saving technologies.

## In the Media

**[Code Snitching: Nashvillians Are Weaponizing Metro Codes Against ‘Undesirable’ Neighbors](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/coverstory/code-snitching-nashvillians-are-weaponizing-metro-codes-against-undesirable-neighbors/article_5e94bd56-0c67-11ed-af4e-e3d04ad7e500.html)**\\

Cover story of the July 28, 2022 issue of the Nashville Scene. I assisted journalist Radley Balko (Washington Post, Nashville Scene) in analyzing the use of metro code violation reports in gentrifying areas. I found that, even when controlling for a home's condition and other factors, lower-valued homes in gentrifying areas were more likely to have reports against them than higher-valued homes.

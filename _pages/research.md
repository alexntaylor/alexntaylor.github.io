## A Few Things I'm Working On...

**Public Symbols and Voting Behavior: Confederate Monuments in the Post-Reconstruction South**

**The Impact of the Black Death on the Adoption of the Printing Press**\\
(Joint work with Noel D. Johnson and Andrew Thomas)

## In the Media

**[Code Snitching: Nashvillians Are Weaponizing Metro Codes Against ‘Undesirable’ Neighbors](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/coverstory/code-snitching-nashvillians-are-weaponizing-metro-codes-against-undesirable-neighbors/article_5e94bd56-0c67-11ed-af4e-e3d04ad7e500.html)**

Cover story of the July 28, 2022 issue of the Nashville Scene. I assisted journalist Radley Balko (Washington Post, Nashville Scene) in analyzing the use of metro code violation reports in gentrifying areas. I found that, even when controlling for a home's condition and other factors, lower-valued homes in gentrifying areas were more likely to have reports against them than higher-valued homes.

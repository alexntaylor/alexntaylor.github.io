<h2>{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].about_me | default: "Welcome!" }}</h2>

<p> I am an Economics PhD student at George Mason University. I received my Bachelors in 2019 and my Masters (also from George Mason) in 2021. </p>

<p> I conduct quantitative research in economic history and historical political economy. Specifically, I am currently interested in the causes and consequences of media and information revolutions. I'm also interested in how our relationship with culture affects societies, as well as the effects of government policy on this relationship. I believe these topics are highly important in the present, and that exploring the past can provide useful information for today. </p>

<p> I'm also interested in applied econometrics and causal inference methods, primarily using R. These topics are rapidly changing, but there are an abundance of helpful resources online. Check out my Resources page for helpful links! </p>

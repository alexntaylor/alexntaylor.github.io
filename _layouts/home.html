<h2>{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].about_me | default: "Welcome!" }}</h2>

<p> I am an Economics PhD Candidate at George Mason University. I received my Bachelors in 2019 and my Masters (also from George Mason) in 2021. </p>

<p> I am an applied microeconomist researching economic history and political economy. My current interests include culture, media, and technology, their impact throughout history, and their relevance today. </p>

<p> I will be on the 2023-24 job market. My job market paper, "Monumental Effects: Confederate Monuments in the Post-Reconstruction South," can be found <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4451402">here.</a> </p>

<p> I'm generally interested in applied econometrics and causal inference methods. These topics are rapidly changing and keeping up can be tough, but there are many resources available online. Check out my Resources page for helpful links. </p>

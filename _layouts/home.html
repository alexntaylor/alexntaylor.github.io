<h2>{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].about_me | default: "Welcome!" }}</h2>

<p> I am an Assistant Professor of Economics in the Schroeder School of Business at the University of Evansville. <span style="color: purple;">Go Aces!</span> </p>

<p> I graduated with my PhD in economics from George Mason University in 2024. I received my Bachelors in 2019 and my Masters in 2021. </p>

<p> I am an applied microeconomist researching economic history and political economy. My current interests include culture, media, and technology with specific applications in the Postbellum US South and Early Modern Europe. </p>

<!--<p> I am on the 2023-24 job market. My job market paper, "Monumental Effects: Confederate Monuments in the Post-Reconstruction South," can be found <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4451402">here</a>. You can also <a href="https://theconversation.com/when-confederate-glorifying-monuments-went-up-in-the-south-voting-in-black-areas-went-down-208275"> read a summary at The Conversation</a>. </p>-->

<p> I'm generally interested in applied econometrics and causal inference methods. These topics are rapidly changing and keeping up can be tough, but there are many resources available online. Check out my Resources page for helpful links. </p>
